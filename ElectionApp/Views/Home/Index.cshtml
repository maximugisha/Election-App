        <h1>Makerere Engineering Society</h1>
        <p>MES, as it is commonly referred to, traces its roots back to 1971, a time when most engineering  disciplines were introduced in the University and Uganda as a whole. Founded by Mr. Turyamureeba in  1971, the club has played a big role in shaping the lives and the attitudes of several great men and  women in the country by equipping them with interpersonal, leadership and social skills indispensable  in the development of successful careers which has promoted both national and global development.
It is the pioneer students’ organisation in the College Of Engineering, Design Art and Technology and  boasts of a rich vein of products over the years in terms of well placed engineers and professors as well  as other professionals.
